# ✍🏻 Read data from a file descriptor 

Get_next_line is the second @42 project. The function allows reading a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor.

This project has been the opportunity to dig highly interesting concepts in C programming:

- using (one or many) ***static variables***
- ***allocation*** (from stack or heap memory)
- manipulation and life cycle of a ***buffer***
